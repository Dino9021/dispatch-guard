"""Publish the private repository's committed tree to the public GitHub snapshot.

    python Tools/publish-public.py            # show the plan, then ask for `confirm`
    python Tools/publish-public.py --push     # do it without asking: sync, commit, push

⭐ WHAT THIS IS. The private repository is the only working copy and carries its full history
plus `Memory/`. The public repository is a published SNAPSHOT: one commit per release, no
`Memory/`, and each commit names the private commit it came from so the reasoning is always
one lookup away.

⛔ IT MIRRORS THE TREE - IT DOES NOT COMPUTE A DELTA. "Copy what changed since version X" is
the obvious shape and it is wrong: a delta carries additions and edits and silently misses
DELETIONS and renames, so a file removed privately lives on in public for ever. A mirror
cannot miss one, and it is idempotent - running it twice changes nothing the second time.

⛔ AND IT PUBLISHES `git archive HEAD`, NOT THE WORKING TREE. The archive contains exactly what
is committed: no untracked scratch, no ignored files, nothing half-finished. Publishing a
working tree publishes whatever happened to be open at the time.

⛔ `Memory/` IS EXCLUDED BY RULE, NOT BY .gitignore, and that is deliberate. Neither repository
ignores it any more - the private one TRACKS it on purpose - so the only thing standing between
a private work log and a public repository is this script. Belt and braces: the public
`.gitignore` also gets a `Memory/` line, so a stray folder cannot be committed by hand either.

⚠ EVERY PUBLISH IS SECRET-SCANNED, with a positive control. This is the one direction where a
mistake cannot be taken back.
